# Cuda Path TracerBased on Aras [toy path tracer](https://github.com/aras-p/ToyPathTracer).The main motivation is to show how easy/hard it is to use CUDA to boost the performance of existing applications, to learn how to identify performance bottlenecks, and to improve them. I will be documenting my progress in my [dev blog](https://voxel-tracer.github.io/cuda-pathtracer-index/).
